Before you start to collect structural data from 99Design:
- **First** run main_page.py to get contest list.
- **Second** run main_afterpage.py to get dataset in every 6(or other) hours.
- **Third** after collecting data sample with acceptable size, run main_SimCal.py to get Similarity Score for image pairs.

For any details may concerned, ask me at your convenience.
