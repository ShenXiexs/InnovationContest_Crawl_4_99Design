### Before you start to collect structural data from 99Design:
- **First** run *main_page.py* to get contest list.
- **Second** run *main_afterpage.py* to get dataset in every 6(or other) hours.
- **Third** after collecting data sample with acceptable size, run *PNG2JPG.py* to transform images and then *main_SimCal.py* to get Similarity Score(measured in VGG16 and SIFT algorithems) for image pairs.

For any details may concerned, ask me at your convenience.
